# Stuttered-Speech-recognition

*B.Tech final year project, designed algorithm to remove stuttering from a voice sample and passed to Google voice API for recognition*

* Modified an existing algorithm to facilitate speech recognition for people suffering from stuttering.
* Performed audio processing and stutter removal in Matlab.
* Designed a neural network to learn from training samples to remove stutter from new test inputs in python, this new audio was then passed to the Google speech API to be recognized without the stutter.
