This is my first review - samp1
I'm using my computer - s1
I'm reading a book
I like to play games
Tom is going to school
It's time to eat - s5
I'm sitting on a chair
I'm eating my food
This is the best moment
The light is on
I'm typing on my laptop
Time to pack my luggage
Let's go home
My flight is tomorrow
I like my red shirt
Let's watch a cricket match
Game of thrones is amazing
I want to work at Google
What is the time?
It is really hot
Practice makes perfect
Manchester United is a great club
Time to play the game
I hear voices in my head
They council me, they understand
They talk to me
Don't do this
I need my blanket
Call my doctor
I'm meeting with my friends
